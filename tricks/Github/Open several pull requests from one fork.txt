When forking a repositiory and creating pull requests all pull requests are collected into one long commit.

To make independent pull request commits you have to use an individual branch for each commit in your fork.

Follow the following steps:

- Fork the repository (= master, keep this clean, do not make any pull requests to this main branch)
- Clone this repo to your local machine

- Make a new copy of this master directory on your local machine for each branch you need
- Right click this directory -> TourtoiseGit -> Create Branch
	- Select a unique name for this branch
	- Check "Switch to new branch"

- Make your changes and commit to server
- On Server in your fork you can switch between the branches and make your pull requests
